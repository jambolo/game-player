//! Game State Module
//!
//! This module implements the state components and traits, providing the necessary interface for the game-specific state and
//! logic.

/// IDs of the players in a two-player game.
///
/// This enumeration defines the two possible players. The numeric values (0 and 1) can be used for array indexing and other
/// performance-critical operations. These are provided for convenience and are not required to be used.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # use hidden_game_player::PlayerId;
/// let current_player = PlayerId::ALICE;
/// let player_index = current_player as usize; // 0
/// ```
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]

    ALICE = 0,
    BOB = 1,
}

impl PlayerId {
    /// Returns the other player
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use hidden_game_player::PlayerId;
    /// assert_eq!(PlayerId::ALICE.other(), PlayerId::BOB);
    /// assert_eq!(PlayerId::BOB.other(), PlayerId::ALICE);

/// A trait representing the state.
///
/// This trait defines the core interface that a game-specific state must implement.
///
/// # Core Concepts
/// ## Fingerprinting
/// A state must provide a unique fingerprint (hash) that can be used for:
/// - Transposition tables in game tree search
/// - Duplicate position detection
/// - State caching and memoization
///
/// ## Turn Management
/// The trait tracks which player should move next, enabling:
/// - Alternating play enforcement
/// - Player-specific evaluation functions
/// - Turn-based game logic
///
/// ## State Transitions
/// Game states can store references to expected responses, allowing:
/// - Pre-computed move sequences
/// - Principal variation storage
/// - Game tree navigation
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # use hidden_game_player::{State, PlayerId};
///
/// #[derive(Clone, Default)]
/// struct MyAction;
///
/// #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
/// struct MyGameState {
///     board: [u8; 64],
///     current_player: PlayerId,
///     game_over: bool,
///     // other game-specific fields...
/// }
///
/// impl State for MyGameState {
///    type Action = MyAction;
///     fn fingerprint(&self) -> u64 {
///         // Generate unique hash for this position
///         // Implementation depends on game specifics
///         42 // placeholder
///     }
///
///     fn whose_turn(&self) -> u8 {
///         self.current_player as u8
///     }
///
///     fn is_terminal(&self) -> bool {
///         self.game_over
///     }
///
///     fn apply(&self, _action: &MyAction) -> Self {
///         MyGameState {
///             board: self.board,
///             current_player: self.current_player.other(),
///             game_over: false,
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
pub trait State: Sized {
    /// The type representing actions/moves in this game
    type Action: Clone;

    /// Returns a unique fingerprint (hash) for this state.
    ///
    /// The fingerprint must be statistically unique across all possible game states to avoid hash collisions in transposition
    /// tables and state caches. Identical game positions must always produce identical fingerprints.
    ///
    /// # Implementation Requirements
    /// - **Deterministic**: Same position always produces same fingerprint
    /// - **Collision-resistant**: Different positions should produce different and uncorrelated fingerprints
    /// - **Fast**: Called frequently during game tree search
    /// - **Position-dependent**: Only depends on the current state and independent of move history.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique fingerprint
